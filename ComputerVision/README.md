Project Description

This object detection model trained on Open Images V4 with ImageNet pre-trained Inception Resnet V2 as image feature extractor detects a plethora of objects in any picture! This project was created with the use of Jupyter Notebook, Google Colaboratory, and Python. It also uses NumPY, PIL, matplotlib, Tensorflow, Tensorflowhub, and six libraries. I also added plenty of comments to further my understanding and the reader's understanding of how this model operates as computer vision can be quite complicated at times :).
